# OOP Assignment: Superhero & Animal Polymorphism 🦸‍♂️🐾

This repository contains another set of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercises.  
It is divided into **two parts**:

---

## 🦸 Assignment: Superhero Class
- File: `week5assignment.py`
- I created a `Superhero` class that inherits from a `Character` class.
- Demonstrates:
  - Attributes (`name`, `age`, `universe`, `power`, `weapon`)
  - Methods (`attack()`, `hero_info()`)
  - Constructor (`__init__`)
  - Inheritance (Superhero inherits from Character)

### Example Output:
Name: Spider-Man, Age: 25, Universe: Marvel, Power: Web-Slinging, Weapon: Web Shooters
Spider-Man uses Web-Slinging!
Spider-Man attacks with Web Shooters!

Name: Batman, Age: 35, Universe: DC, Power: Stealth, Weapon: Batarang        
Batman uses Stealth!
Batman attacks with Batarang!  


---

## 🐾 Activity: Animal Polymorphism
- File: `animal_polymorphism.py`
- I created an `Animal` base class, with child classes:
  - `Dog`
  - `Cat`
  - `Bird`
- Each class overrides the `sound()` method.

### Example Output:
Polymorphism in action:

Woof!

Meow!

Chirp!
